### Project 2 Homework - Story Telling with Data

### U. Richmond Data Analytics Bootcamp (November, 2019)

> In this assignment, Diana A. and Marie C. use all of the analysis and visualization 
> tools taught thus far to complete a data analytics project and "tell a story"
> through data.

### Satisfaction of requirements

* The Hazards and Health visualization includes a Python-Flask-powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and access through MongoDB databases
* Our project falls into the dashboard category with multiple charts, using Leaflet and Chart
* We include ChartJS and ESRI Leaflet plug-ins that were not covered in class
* The data sets are well above the required 100 records as we acquired multiple data sets from several agencies and web sites for health, hazard, financial, and geographic data.
* The web page has considerable user interaction including drop-down menus, active links to supporting materials, optional baselayers, map overlays, and an update option.

### Background

> With our backgrounds in finance and environmental sciences, we apply 
> data science techniques to examine social, health, financial, and environmental
> data mashups. Our objective is to gain new insights by combining data from different
> disciplines.

> In this study, we conduct a preliminary investigation between risk and death
> from natural hazards, specifically earthquakes and tsunamis, or natural causes
> in the United States. We look at geographic distribution and medicare payments as a > financial proxy to show how different states may suffer non-uniformly from various > health hazards.

### Key Takeaways

*The US faces considerable exposure to earthquakes and tsunamis in heavily populated coastal regions.  New government services to provide forecasts and warnings are in early operational stages.

*Death from natural causes, particularly heart disease, outweigh annual deaths by natural hazards and show specific concentrations in the interior of the US.

*The last decade has seen an increase in "untimely" deaths more akin to a natural disaster, which has associated programs for "mitigation, response, and recovery" actions.

*Understanding regional disparities in long-term health risks and exposure to natural hazards may contribute to national discussions on joint improvements to preparedness and health-care programs.
